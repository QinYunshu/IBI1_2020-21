From these data, we can summarize that human has a large sequence similarity with mouse compared to a random sequence. This may be interpreted that human and mouse are all mammal with the same ancestors.
However, a genetic similarity near to 90% dosen't mean they are 90% the same. 10% discrepancy in gene can cause a huge difference in phenotype, which can explain why we are obviously different from mouse in appearance.
